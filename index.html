        <p>Welcome to my website! My name's Imaad and I'm a 17 yr old school student who likes programming and making videos.</p>

        <h2>👨🏽‍💻 Programming</h2>
        <p>After learning Python in school, I found out that I really enjoyed programming and problem solving. I decided that I wanted to learn other programming languages and even try to make my own apps (more on that in the next section)! Since then, I've managed to learn Java and more recently Kotlin (for making Android Apps), as well as HTML and CSS (for making websites).</p>

        <h2>🎱 Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Although I love programming, it's not the only activity I do in my life. I used to be quite good at drawing and I am now slowly getting back to it. Also, I like to read books, as they're a great way of expanding the knowledge you have and give you deeper insights into the world around you. One of the things I'm trying to keep fit and exercise, usually I would go to the gym 3 times a week, but now that's not an option so home workouts are the way to go. I also enjoy playing many sports, such as: football, cricket, tennis, badminton, squash.</p>

      <section class="goals">
        <h2>🎯 Goals</h2>
        <p>My next goals are to learn JavaScript in order to make more interactive websites, and to create my own Machine Learning models with Python. For university, I would like to study Computer Science at Oxbridge or Imperial College. In the future, I would like to start my own business and also a YouTube channel!</p>
